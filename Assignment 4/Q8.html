            <h2>The Future of Frontend Development</h2>
            <div class="multi-column">
                <p>Frontend development has rapidly evolved over the last decade. With the rise of frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, building dynamic and responsive interfaces has become easier and more structured.</p>
                <p>CSS has also grown, with features like Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties giving developers full control over layout and design. Responsive design ensures accessibility across devices.</p>
                <p>In the future, frontend tools may use AI to auto-generate code from design. Browser APIs continue expanding, allowing for richer applications without plugins.</p>
                <p>Developers should focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability as the field continues to grow. Keeping up with tools like Vite, Astro, and WebAssembly will be key.</p>
                <p>This marks an exciting era where frontend is not just about visuals, but about powerful user experiences and fast-loading applications.</p>
